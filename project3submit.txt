Project Name:  Project 3

Project Description:  The user will open the app and be greeted with a login screen, or the option to
                      create a new user account.

                      Once the user logs in with a valid account, they'll be brought to the main activity
                      showing a map. The map will display circles / bubbles representing points of interest.

                      If the user travels to a point of interest and is within a certain distance to it a button
                      will appear that will allow the user to say "I Was Here".

                      Upon saying (pressing the button) "I Was Here" the user can then put in a short
                      comment (or choose not to).

                      After doing so the user can view the other users that have visited that place and their
                      respective comments.
